Here is my github for project euler.
Main reason I made it was so that I could get used
to using git for my coop job.
I can also start using the git repo to get access
to my project euler solutions even when I am at the
school, how dandy.


Anyways,I hope now random person is reading this.
That would be kinda creepy.
